# DairyDash 🥛

DairyDash is a real-time milk delivery and daily ledger management system for gated apartment communities in India.

## Problem

Small dairy vendors still rely on notebooks or WhatsApp messages to track daily milk delivery and monthly payments. This leads to errors, confusion, and lack of transparency for customers.

## Solution

DairyDash provides a simple web-based platform where:

- Admin (milk shop owner) updates daily milk delivery
- Customers can view daily delivery status
- Monthly bills are calculated automatically
- Designed specifically for apartment-based subscriptions

## Tech Stack (MVP)

- Frontend: Next.js (React + TypeScript)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: SQLite
- Real-time updates: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## Project Status

🚧 Initial setup completed. Development in progress.
