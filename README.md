# DairyDash 🥛

DairyDash is a real-time milk delivery and daily ledger system for small dairy shops in India.

## Why this project?

Many milk vendors still use notebooks or WhatsApp to track daily milk delivery and payments. This causes confusion, errors, and no transparency for customers.

## What DairyDash does

- Admin (milk shop) updates daily milk delivery
- Customers can see daily delivery status
- Monthly bill is calculated automatically
- Designed for gated apartment communities

## Tech Stack (Learning Version)

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: SQLite
- Real-time updates: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
